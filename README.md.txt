# Iris Classifier (Decision Tree)

## Overview
Builds a decision‑tree classifier on the classic Iris dataset using scikit‑learn.
The following steps are involved
#load the feature data
#split the data for test and training
#training a model with selected algorithm Decision tree
#after model is trained it can be used to test
#evaluate the model by checking the accuracy with test and predicted data.
#check the accuracy with different algorithm
